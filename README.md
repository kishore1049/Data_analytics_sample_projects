# IPL Data Analysis (2008-2022)

This project analyzes data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) spanning the years 2008 to 2022. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project explores various aspects of IPL matches, teams, players, and performances to generate insights and visualizations.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to uncover trends and patterns in IPL matches using historical data. The analysis includes:
- Team and player performance over the years.
- Match outcomes and factors influencing wins.
- Trends in scoring, wickets, and player statistics.
- Venue-specific performance and other interesting insights.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Visualizations of key insights
- Summary statistics and trends across seasons

## Dataset

The dataset includes match-by-match details from IPL seasons 2008 to 2022. It typically consists of the following key columns:

- `Match_ID`: Unique identifier for each match
- `Season`: Year of the IPL season
- `Team1` and `Team2`: Teams participating in the match
- `Winner`: Match winner
- `Player_of_the_Match`: Best performer of the match
- `Venue`: Location of the match
- `Toss_Winner` and `Toss_Decision`: Toss results
- `Result`: Outcome of the match (e.g., win by runs or wickets)

## Technologies Used
